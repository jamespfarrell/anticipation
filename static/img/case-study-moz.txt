The German Red Cross has been working in Mozambique since 2000, as the South-East African country is repeatedly affected by natural disasters. After the two cyclones Idai and Kenneth, in spring 2019, we are intensively supporting the Mozambique Red Cross Society in helping those affected. In addition to improving hygienic conditions with hygiene articles, we focus on temporary accommodation. For this purpose we distribute tools and material. Disaster prevention and disaster management remain the key area of our activities. Mozambique, for example, is one of the pilot countries for forecast-based financing â€“ early assistance for extreme weather conditions.
