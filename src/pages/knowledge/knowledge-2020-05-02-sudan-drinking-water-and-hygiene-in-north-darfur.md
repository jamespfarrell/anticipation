  The conflict in Darfur, that has been going on for already ten years, has a
  devastating impact und the local population: Due to the fact that
  infrastructure, villages and fields have been widely destroyed, food, clean
  drinking water and sanitation facilities are no longer available in most
  areas. The insufficient hygiene facilities are causing avoidable diseases.
  Despite the difficult security situation, the German Red Cross has been
  present in Darfur for more than 10 years. It has been active in Sudan for more
  than 20 years, working closely together with its partner organization, the
  Sudanese Red Crescent Society (SRCS).

  Clean drinking water and improved hygiene

  From January 2014 to January 2015, a project aimed at improving the drinking water and hygiene situation in the Mellit region of North Darfur, funded by the German Organization for International Cooperation (GIZ), was implemented.


  Since March 2015, some of the project activities have been continued in six villages in the area of Mellit with a total of 19,000 people. In three of the villages, schools have been equipped with in each case six latrines for students and teachers. In order to secure water supplies beside the sanitation facilities as, water reservoirs were built that provide access to clean drinking water.

  In addition, 140 households inhabited by members of underprivileged groups, for example single women and older persons, receive materials and technical support for building their own latrines. In every village, hygiene trainings and sensitization campaigns about the maintenance of water points and environmental protection are conducted. These trainings target community members of the villages as well as students and teachers. Staff and volunteers of the Sudanese Red Crescent Society have also undergone these trainings so that they have the ability to pass on their knowledge in refresher trainings and home visits in the communities. The formation and training of water user committees in all six villages ensures that the communities are able to protect latrines and water points against contamination after the end of the project.
